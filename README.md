I am a tech enthusiast. In my life, I have always wanted to be at the innovation end of technology.
I have skills in C, Java, as well as elementary Python and Django. I am now part of the ALX-Holberton Software Engineering
Programme, and we are set to learn a lot more things. 
When I am not coding, or studying, I am out there enjoying nature.
